# jsdl3

## What is this?

An experiment for learning about the [Java 22+ Foreign Function and Memory API (FFM)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html)
by exposing [SDL3 `v3.2.0+`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/release-3.2.0) as a Java library.

## How does it work?

I'll let you know once there's an 'it' that works.

## Project Notes

### Setup

1) Created this repo as a multi-module gradle project by running `gradle init` in an empty root folder
    - added a root `build.gradle.kts` file since it wasn't included by default
    - modified `settings.gradle.kts` for the following gradle module name changes:
       - renamed the generated `app` module to `jsdl3-app`, as it will contain a test application
       - renamed the generated `list` module to `sdl-native` to contain SDL code and build config
       - renamed the generated `utilities` module to `sdl-bindings` to contain SDL java bindings generated by `jextract`
    - replaced the `jsdl3-app` module default package and source with `net.bplo.jsdl3.App`
    - removed generated packages and source from `sdl-native` and `sdl-bindings` modules
2) Add [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) as a git submodule under the `sdl-native` gradle module
    - add and initialize the new git submodule:
        - `git submodule add https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git ./sdl-native/src/main/cpp`
    - pin submodule to target commit for tag [`release-3.2.0`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/release-3.2.0)
        - `pushd ./sdl-native/src/main/cpp && git checkout release-3.2.0 && popd`
        - `git submodule update`
3) Spend lots of time making :kissing: faces at gradle to create build tasks related to `jextract` in `sdl-bindings`
    - there's a lot to say about this piece, because figuring out how to use gradle is maddening
      and I learned a bunch from this process but didn't write it out as I went so that I didn't lose my mind
    - :pushpin: rework the `unpack` task to use the built-in `Tar` task type in gradle instead of `Exec`
4) Spend less time making :kissing: faces at gradle to create build tasks related to `cmake` in `sdl-native`
    - there's a lot to say here too, especially since there's the possibility of leveraging gradle's
      `cpp-application` and/or `cpp-library` plugins rather than invoking `cmake` directly in `Exec` tasks
    - also had a surprisingly amount of difficulty setting up a gradle task to copy the sdl library file
      out of `./sdl-native/build/[Debug|Release]/SDL3.dll` into `./jsdl3-app` so that it would be available
      to be loaded from the current working directory when running the app, so I just did it manually for now
5) With most of the pieces in place, I started adding more bits to the example app in `./jsdl3-app`
    - unexpectedly, there are some subtleties of working with the generated bindings that I'm figuring out as I go
    - seems like all functions can be called through `SDL_h.*`, even those that are in the `SDL_h_#.java` files
    - allocating data / structs that are used across the jvm / native boundary is done via an `Arena`,
      and the example app is currently setup with a single 'confined' arena for all SDL data,
      I plan to make some other arenas for different scopes, starting with a per-frame arena for allocating
      the `SDL_Event` used in the event handling loop
    - many structs like `SDL_FPoint, SDL_FRect` provide `allocate(arena)` and `allocateArray(arena, count)`
      methods for simple creation, though it doesn't look like there's a `free()` that I've found so far,
      likely because deallocation is handled automatically when the allocating `Arena` goes out of scope
    - some structs/types like `SDL_Window, SDL_Renderer` aren't structs in the sense of having fields
      that can be read/written, but rather they are opaque handles, so working with them involves
      allocating the memory, passing it into some SDL function to instantiate the underlying object,
      then getting the native pointer from the allocated memory for use in other methods that reference it
        - :thinking: I'm not certain that last piece is technically necessary, but I haven't tested it yet
    - for native structs with fields we need to use, the jextract generated interface provides nice
      getters and setters for the fields in a java `record` sort of style
    - for arrays of native structs, we need to use `{Type}.asSlice(arr, index)` to get a pointer to
      a single element, and then we can use the standard methods to interact with the element
